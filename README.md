# Stocks-analysis

## ## Purpose

The purpose of the analysis is to refactor an existing vba code and determine the elapse run time for the script. Check whether the refactor script run faster or not.

# ## Appraoch

To determine the run time of the VBA code, the run time was taken at three multiple times. The three times represent each for ""Before the code was refactored"" and ""After the code was refactored" and their averages were computed.

# ## Result

# ### Elapse Time after refactoring
